# Chapter 3: Transformer anatomy: knowing what you'll optimize

This directory contains the notebook for Chapter 3, where we lay the essential groundwork for re-architecting. Before a surgeon can operate, they must have a deep understanding of anatomy. This chapter is dedicated to dissecting various LLMs to understand the evolution of their internal structure. By the end of this chapter, you will have the fundamental knowledge and practical skills to navigate the internal architecture of any modern LLM, preparing you for the surgical techniques in the chapters to come.

- **LLM**: `distilbert/distilgpt2`, `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B`, `google/gemma-3-270m`, `microsoft/Phi-4-mini-instruct`
- **Dataset**: N/A (Analytical notebook)
- **Description**: In this notebook, we dissect a range of models to build a strong mental map of modern LLM anatomy, from the classic architecture of DistilGPT2 to modern evolutions like Llama-3.2 and Gemma-3, and alternative designs like Phi-4.
