# OptiPFair Documentation

Welcome to the OptiPFair documentation. OptiPFair is a Python library for structured pruning of large language models, with a focus on GLU architectures and fairness analysis.

## Why Prune Language Models?

Pruning helps to reduce the size and computational requirements of LLMs, making them:

- **Faster** for inference
- **More efficient** in terms of memory usage
- **Easier to deploy** on resource-constrained devices

## Why Analyze Bias in Language Models?

Understanding bias in language models is crucial for:

- **Ensuring fairness** in AI applications
- **Identifying problematic patterns** in model behavior
- **Developing mitigation strategies** through pruning
- **Making informed decisions** about model deployment

## Key Features

- **GLU Architecture-Aware Pruning**: Maintains the paired nature of gate_proj and up_proj layers
- **Depth Pruning**: Remove entire transformer layers for aggressive efficiency gains
- **Layer Importance Analysis**: Analyze transformer layers using cosine similarity to inform pruning decisions
- **Knowledge Distillation (v0.4.0+)**: Recover student quality after pruning with `opf.distill_model`
- **Bias Visualization Tools**: Comprehensive analysis of how models process demographic attributes
- **Quantitative Bias Metrics**: Numeric measurements for consistent evaluation
- **Multiple Neuron Selection Methods**: PPM (Peak-to-Peak Magnitude), VOW, and PON for different pruning strategies
- **Flexible Pruning Targets**: Support for both pruning percentage and target expansion rate
- **Layer Selection Methods**: Choose specific layers or use automatic selection strategies
- **Simple API and CLI**: Easy to use interfaces for Python and command line
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bars and detailed statistics

**Note:** The default neuron selection method is PPM (Peak-to-Peak Magnitude), formally described in: *Martra, P. (2025). Fragile Knowledge, Robust Instruction-Following: The Width Pruning Dichotomy in Llama-3.2. ArXiv. https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22671*. For backward compatibility, the parameter value `"MAW"` is still accepted.

## Supported Model Architectures

OptiPFair is designed to work with transformer-based models that use GLU architecture in their MLP components, including:

- LLaMA family (LLaMA, LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3)
- Mistral models
- And other models with similar GLU architectures
