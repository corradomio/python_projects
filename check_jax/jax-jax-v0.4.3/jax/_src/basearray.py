  """Experimental Array base class for JAX

  `jax.Array` is meant as the future public interface for instance checks and
  type annotation of JAX array objects. JAX Array object types are currently in
  flux, and this class only fully supports the new `jax.experimental.Array`, which
  will soon replace the old-style {class}`DeviceArray`, {class}`ShardedDeviceArray`,
  {class}`GlobalDeviceArray`, etc.

  The compatibility is summarized in the following table:

  ================================  ======================  =========================
  object type                       ``isinstance`` support  type annotation support
  ================================  ======================  =========================
  {class}`DeviceArray`               ✅                      ❌
  {class}`ShardedDeviceArray`        ✅                      ❌
  {class}`GlobalDeviceArray`         ✅                      ❌
  {class}`~jax._src.core.Tracer`     ✅                      ✅
  {class}`~jax.experimental.Array`   ✅                      ✅
  ================================  ======================  =========================

  In other words, ``isinstance(x, jax.Array)`` will return True for any of these types,
  whereas annotations such as ``x : jax.Array`` will only type-check correctly for
  instances of {class}`~jax._src.core.Tracer` and {class}`jax.experimental.Array`, and
  not for the other soon-to-be-deprecated array types.
