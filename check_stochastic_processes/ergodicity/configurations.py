"""
This file contains the main adjustable configurations for the Ergodicity Library.
These are the most important global variables that can be changed by the user.
The user can change the values of these variables to customize the behavior of the package.
Initially, the parameters are set to enable explanatory command line outputs and conduct
analysis pipelines with parameters optimized for Levy processes and computational power of a personal computer.

use_external_simulators = False # Not recommended to set True. This parameter is used to enable or disable the use of external simulators, such as for example the simulators provided by the stochastic library.
# External simulators are not available for many processes and may be problematic for other processes, but they are typically faster. So use them if you want speed and if you are sure that they work for your process.

If enabled, the code will use the stochastic differential equations explicitly to simulate the process. If disabled, the code will use the simulation with probability distributions without the differentials.
# Both types of simulations are typically comparable in terms of speed and precision, but the simulaton with the differential usually allows for explicit representation of the process and is more readable by the user
