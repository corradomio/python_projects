This module provides foundational stochastic processes used in simulations, particularly focusing on
Itô and non-Itô processes. These processes are employed to model various types of continuous-time
stochastic behaviors, including Brownian motion, Bessel processes, and more complex, specialized
stochastic processes like the Brownian bridge, Brownian meander, and fractional Brownian motion.

class LevyStableStandardProcess(LevyStableProcess):
    """
    LevyStableStandardProcess represents a standardized version of the Lévy stable process, a class of
    continuous-time stochastic processes known for their ability to model heavy-tailed distributions and
    asymmetry. This process, denoted as (X_t)_{t≥0}, is a special case of the general Lévy stable process
    with fixed scale and location parameters (set to 1/2**0.5 and 0 correspondingly). It is primarily characterized by two parameters:
    Scale is set to 1/2**0.5 because it corresponds to the standard deviation of the process when the process is Gaussian.

    1. α (alpha): The stability parameter, where 0 < α ≤ 2. This parameter determines the tail heaviness
       of the distribution. As α approaches 2, the process behaves more like Brownian motion, while
       smaller values lead to heavier tails and more extreme jumps.

    2. β (beta): The skewness parameter, where -1 ≤ β ≤ 1. This parameter controls the asymmetry of the
       distribution. When β = 0, the process is symmetric.

    The process is standardized with a scale parameter of 1/√2 and a location parameter of 0. This
    standardization allows for easier comparison and analysis across different α and β combinations.

    Key properties of the LevyStableStandardProcess include:

    - Self-similarity: The distribution of the process at any time t is the same as that at time 1,
      up to a scaling factor.

    - Stable distributions: The sum of independent copies of the process follows the same distribution,
      up to scaling and shifting.

    - Potential for infinite variance: For α < 2, the process has infinite variance, capturing extreme
      events more effectively than Gaussian processes.

    The 'standard' type is added to the process classification.
    This allows for more straightforward theoretical analysis and comparison between different
    parameterizations of the Lévy stable family.

    Researchers and practitioners should be aware that while this standardized form offers analytical
    advantages, it may require rescaling and shifting for practical applications. The process's rich
    behavior, especially for α < 2, necessitates careful interpretation and often specialized numerical
    methods for simulation and statistical inference.

class MultivariateBrownianMotion(ItoProcess):
    """
    MultivariateBrownianMotion represents a generalization of the standard Brownian motion to multiple dimensions,
    providing a powerful tool for modeling correlated random processes in various fields. This continuous-time
    stochastic process, denoted as (X_t)_{t≥0} where X_t is a vector in R^n, is characterized by its drift vector
    μ ∈ R^n and a positive semi-definite covariance matrix Σ. For any time interval [s,t], the increment
    X_t - X_s follows a multivariate normal distribution N(μ(t-s), Σ(t-s)). Key properties include: independent
    and stationary increments, continuous sample paths in each dimension, and the preservation of the Markov
    property. The process starts at 0 (X_0 = 0) and has an expected value of E[X_t] = μt and covariance matrix
    Cov(X_t) = Σt. As a multivariate Itô process, it extends the mathematical framework of stochastic calculus
    to vector-valued processes, enabling the modeling of complex, interrelated phenomena. MultivariateBrownianMotion
    finds extensive applications across various domains: in finance for modeling correlated asset prices and risk
    factors, in physics for describing the motion of particles in multiple dimensions, in biology for analyzing
    the joint evolution of different species or genes, and in engineering for simulating multi-dimensional noise
    in control systems. This implementation is initialized with a name, optional process class, drift vector, and
    scale matrix (representing Σ), allowing for flexible specification of the process's statistical properties.
    It's categorized under both "multivariate" and "brownian" types, reflecting its nature as a vector-valued
    extension of Brownian motion. The class handles the dimensionality automatically based on the input drift
    vector, and stores the state in the _X attribute. The _external_simulator flag is set to False, indicating
    that the simulation is handled internally. Researchers and practitioners should be aware of the increased
    complexity in simulating and analyzing multivariate processes, particularly in high dimensions, and the
    importance of ensuring the positive semi-definiteness of the scale matrix for valid covariance structures.

    """
    GeneralizedHyperbolicProcess represents a highly flexible class of continuous-time stochastic processes that
    encompasses a wide range of distributions, including normal, Student's t, variance-gamma, and normal-inverse
    Gaussian as special or limiting cases. This process, denoted as (X_t)_{t≥0}, is characterized by five parameters:
    α (tail heaviness), β (asymmetry), μ (location), δ (scale), and λ (a shape parameter, often denoted as 'a' in
    the implementation). The process is defined through its increments, which follow a generalized hyperbolic
    distribution. Key properties include: semi-heavy tails (heavier than Gaussian but lighter than power-law),
    ability to model skewness, and a complex autocorrelation structure. The process allows for both large jumps
    and continuous movements, making it highly adaptable to various phenomena. It's particularly noted for its
    capacity to capture both the central behavior and the extreme events in a unified framework. The
    GeneralizedHyperbolicProcess finds extensive applications in finance for modeling asset returns, particularly
    in markets exhibiting skewness and kurtosis; in risk management for more accurate tail risk assessment; in
    physics for describing particle movements in heterogeneous media; and in signal processing for modeling
    non-Gaussian noise. This implementation is initialized with parameters α, β, μ (loc), and δ (scale), with
    additional parameters possible through kwargs. It's categorized under both "generalized" and "hyperbolic" types,
    reflecting its nature as a broad, hyperbolic-based process. The class uses a custom increment function,
    indicated by the _external_simulator flag set to False. This allows for precise control over the generation
    of process increments, crucial for accurately representing the complex distribution. Researchers and
    practitioners should be aware of the computational challenges in parameter estimation and simulation,
    particularly in high-dimensional settings or with extreme parameter values. The flexibility of the generalized
    hyperbolic process comes with increased model complexity, requiring careful consideration in application and
    interpretation. Its ability to nest simpler models allows for sophisticated hypothesis testing and model
    selection in empirical studies.

    Attention! The class must be used with caution. The generalized hyperbolic distribution is not convolution-closed.
    It means that the sum of two generalized hyperbolic random variables may be not a generalized hyperbolic random variable.
    This makes the simulation of the process using finite differential problematic.
    A related problem is that it is unclear how to scale time increments dt in the simulations. The process may not be self-similar.
    Or if we make it self-similar by design, many options are possible which lead to different processes.

class ParetoProcess(NonItoProcess):
    """
    ParetoProcess represents a continuous-time stochastic process based on the Pareto distribution, known for
    modeling phenomena with power-law tail behavior. This process, denoted as (X_t)_{t≥0}, is characterized by
    three parameters: shape (α), scale (σ), and location (μ). The Pareto distribution is renowned for its "80-20
    rule" or "law of the vital few" property, making it particularly suitable for modeling size distributions in
    various natural and social contexts.

    Key parameters:

    - shape (α > 0): Determines the tail behavior of the distribution. Smaller values lead to heavier tails,
      representing more extreme events.

    - scale (σ > 0): Sets the minimum scale of the process, effectively acting as a threshold parameter.

    - loc (μ): Shifts the entire distribution, allowing for flexibility in modeling.

    The process exhibits several important properties:

    1. Heavy-tailed behavior: For α < 2, the process has infinite variance, capturing extreme events more
       effectively than processes based on normal distributions.

    2. Scale invariance: The relative probabilities of large events remain consistent regardless of scale.

    3. Power-law decay: The probability of extreme events decays as a power law, rather than exponentially.

    This implementation uses a custom increment function (_external_simulator = False), allowing for precise
    control over the generation of process increments. The class performs validity checks to ensure that the
    shape and scale parameters are strictly positive, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the
    Pareto distribution.

    Researchers and practitioners should be aware of the challenges in parameter estimation, especially for
    small shape values where moments may not exist. The process's heavy-tailed nature can lead to
    counterintuitive results in statistical analyses and requires careful interpretation. While powerful in
    modeling extreme phenomena, the Pareto process should be used judiciously, with consideration of its
    underlying assumptions and their applicability to the system being modeled.

    MultivariateLevy represents a sophisticated extension of the Lévy stable process to multiple dimensions,
    providing a powerful tool for modeling complex, correlated heavy-tailed phenomena. This continuous-time
    stochastic process, denoted as (X_t)_{t≥0} where X_t is a vector in R^n, inherits the fundamental
    characteristics of Lévy stable distributions while incorporating cross-dimensional dependencies.

    Key parameters:

    - α (alpha): Stability parameter (0 < α ≤ 2), governing tail heaviness across all dimensions.

    - β (beta): Skewness parameter (-1 ≤ β ≤ 1), controlling asymmetry.

    - scale: Global scale parameter for the process.

    - loc: Location vector (μ ∈ R^n), shifting the process in each dimension.

    - correlation_matrix: Specifies the correlation structure between dimensions.

    - pseudovariances: Vector of pseudovariances for each dimension, generalizing the concept of variance.

    Advanced features:

    - Tempering: Optional exponential tempering to ensure finite moments.

    - Truncation: 'Hard' or 'soft' truncation options to limit extreme values.

    The process is constructed using a Cholesky decomposition of the correlation matrix, scaled by
    pseudovariances, ensuring a valid covariance structure. This approach allows for modeling complex
    interdependencies while maintaining the heavy-tailed nature of Lévy stable processes in each dimension.

    Key properties:

    1. Multivariate stability: The sum of independent copies of the process follows the same distribution,
       up to affine transformations.

    2. Heavy tails and potential infinite variance in each dimension for α < 2.

    3. Complex dependency structures captured by the correlation matrix and pseudovariances.

    The class implements custom simulation methods, including a specialized increment function that
    respects the multivariate structure. It includes extensive error checking to ensure the validity of
    input parameters, particularly for the correlation matrix and pseudovariances.

    Researchers and practitioners should be aware of the computational challenges in simulating and
    estimating multivariate Lévy stable processes, especially in high dimensions or with extreme
    parameter values. The interplay between α, the correlation structure, and pseudovariances requires
    careful interpretation. While offering great flexibility in modeling complex, heavy-tailed multivariate
    phenomena, users should exercise caution in parameter selection and model interpretation, particularly
    when dealing with empirical data.
