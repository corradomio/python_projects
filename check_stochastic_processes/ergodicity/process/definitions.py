"""
The `definitions.py` module lays the foundation for the Ergodicity Library, introducing core concepts and defining abstract classes for stochastic processes.

**Key Components:**

* **`Process` Class:**

    * The central abstract class for all stochastic processes in the library.

    * Provides a standardized interface for process initialization, property access, and common methods like simulation, moments calculation, and visualization.

* **`ItoProcess` and `NonItoProcess` Classes:**

    * Abstract subclasses of `Process` that categorize processes into Ito (subject to Ito calculus) and non-Ito types.

* **`CustomProcess` Class:**

    * Empowers users to create their own custom stochastic processes within the library's framework.

* **Decorators and Helper Functions:**

    * `simulation_decorator`: Enhances simulation methods with verbose output for easier tracking.

    * `check_simulate_with_differential`: Checks if a process's simulation uses differential methods.

    * `create_correlation_matrix` and `correlation_to_covariance`: Facilitate working with correlated processes.

**Core Functionalities:**

* **Process Initialization and Properties:**

    * Standardizes the creation and attribute access of processes, including names, multiplicative nature, independence of increments, and more.

* **Simulation:**

    * `simulate()`: Primary method for generating sample paths of a process.

    * `simulate_2d()` and `simulate_3d()`: Extend simulation to 2D and 3D processes.

    * `simulate_live_*`: Create dynamic visualizations of simulations.

* **Moments and Distributions:**

    * `moments()`: Calculates the cumulative moments (mean, variance, etc.) of a process.

    * `k_moments()`: Extends moment calculation to higher orders.

    * `simulate_distribution()`: Simulates the probability distribution of a process.

* **Analysis and Visualization:**

    * `ensemble_average()` and `time_average()`: Calculate ensemble and time averages.

    * `self_averaging_time()`: Estimates the time when a process transitions from ensemble-averaged to time-averaged behavior.

    * `plot*`, `visualize_moments`: Provide various plotting and visualization capabilities.

* **Ito-Specific Functionality:**

    * `solve()`: Attempts to find analytical solutions for Ito processes using Ito calculus.

    * `differential()`: Represents the stochastic differential equation of an Ito process.

**Intended Audience:**

* **Researchers and Practitioners:** Leverage the library's core definitions to work with and analyze a wide variety of stochastic processes.

* **Students and Learners:** Gain a deeper understanding of stochastic processes through the clear structure and implementation of fundamental concepts.

* **Developers:** Extend the library's capabilities by building upon these base classes and methods to create new process types and functionalities.
